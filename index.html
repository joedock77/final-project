            was originally formed in 1961, as a merger of the Chouinard Art
            Institute (founded 1921) and the
            <em>Los Angeles Conservatory of Music</em> (founded 1883).[10] Both
            of the formerly existing institutions were going through financial
            difficulties, and the founder of the Art Institute, Nelbert
            Chouinard, was mortally ill. <span>Walt Disney</span> was longtime
            friends with both Chouinard and Lulu May Von Hagen, the chair of the
            Conservatory, and discovered and trained many of his studio's
            artists at the two schools (including Mary Blair, Maurice Noble, and
            some of the Nine Old Men, among others). To keep the
            <strong>educational mission</strong> of the schools alive, the
            merger and expansion of the two institutions was coordinated; a
            process which continued after Walt's death in 1966.[11] Joining him
            in this effort were his brother Roy O. Disney, Nelbert Chouinard,
            Lulu May Von Hagen and Thornton Ladd (Ladd and Kelsey, Architects).
